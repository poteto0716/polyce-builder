# Third-party materials

PolyCE binaries, documentation, examples and runtime scripts are distributed under
[LICENSE](LICENSE). This does not grant rights to third-party materials.

## Compiler and system runtime

The executable was compiled with the standard Ubuntu GCC 13.3 toolchain. It uses
libstdc++, libgcc, glibc/libm and the ELF loader dynamically. No third-party shared
library or static library is shipped separately. CMake links only the project's
own core library into the executable; no EMC executable or recovered library is
built or linked. Internal probe/test applications are not distributed.

GCC runtime/header portions are subject to GPLv3 with the GCC Runtime Library
Exception 3.1. The exception covers eligible compilation of independent modules,
including proprietary programs. See the
[official libstdc++ license documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/license.html),
[GPLv3](LICENSES/GPL-3.0.txt) and
[exception](LICENSES/GCC-Runtime-Library-Exception-3.1.txt).
System glibc is installed by Ubuntu, not redistributed here; its notices and
terms are available in the system package documentation. Python, Bash and LAMMPS
are also user-installed external dependencies, not bundled software.

## PCFF / IFF / silica

These databases and structure files are deliberately not included. The inspected
EMC installation contains GPLv3 text; the official project's listing says MIT.
The historical PCFF database has its own scientific provenance, and its scope of
redistribution permission was not established by either indication.

The IFF 1.5 archive and the authors' public GitHub repository contain parameters
and surface models, but the inspected material does not state an explicit
redistribution license. Citation requests are recorded; they are not treated as
a license to repackage the files. The silica CAR/MDF and their converted MOL2
are excluded as well as the force-field tables and typing templates.

[External data setup](docs/external_data.md) gives official sources, exact filenames,
local installation locations, hashes and citations. The installer copies only
user-obtained files for local use. Generated LAMMPS files containing third-party
coefficients and surface data are not part of this release.

## Scope of this audit

Build configuration, dependencies, the included runtime helpers and data provenance
were inspected. No license is inferred from a file merely being present in the
development installation. No source-available or open-source license is granted
to the PolyCE core. The copyright holder supplied the license text in this release.
